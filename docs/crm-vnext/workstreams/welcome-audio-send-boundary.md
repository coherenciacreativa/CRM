# CRM Core Workstream: Welcome Audio Send Boundary

- `workstream_id`: `welcome-audio-send-boundary`
- `branch`: `codex/crm-core-welcome-audio`
- `worktree_path`: `/Users/alejandrogomez/CRM-core-welcome-audio`
- `consultant_chat`: Welcome audio consultant
- `codex_worker`: Welcome audio lane worker
- `status`: `controlled_candidate_queue_send_approval_design_complete_pending_artifact_review`
- `objective`: Audio asset registry, already-welcomed history, send approval
  packet, duplicate prevention.
- `why_now`: Welcome audio is a high-value action lane, but no send is
  authorized and duplicate prevention must exist before execution.

- `allowed_scope`:
  - design only

  - no execution gates: no DM opening, no welcome audio send, no candidate
    queue generation, no Instagram actions
  - completed no-run controlled candidate queue and sandbox send approval
    packet design for the Controlled Welcome Flow Proof
  - artifact:
    `docs/crm-vnext/instagram-welcome-audio-controlled-candidate-queue-and-sandbox-send-approval-packet-design-v0.md`

  - consultant verdict source:
    `green_to_execute_task_packet_later: crm_core_welcome_audio_controlled_candidate_queue_and_sandbox_send_approval_packet_design_v0`
  - no real state created: no candidate queue, candidate set, candidate,
    approval packet, asset approval, receipt, private artifact,
    already-welcomed/send-history result, send state, or CRM/source state
  - keep send gate closed
- `latest_commit`: pending lane-local commit for controlled candidate queue and
  sandbox send approval packet design
- `latest_receipt`: none
- `blockers`: no audio send approval; no candidate queue approval; no approved
  send packet; no private artifact inspection; no approved audio asset registry
  implementation; no already-welcomed/send-history implementation
- `latest_execution_note`: no execution occurred; no send authority was
  granted.
- `next_approval_needed`: consultant relay artifact review before commit;
  separate future approval before any candidate queue, private artifact
  inspection, DM opening, welcome audio send, Instagram action, MailerLite/Gmail
  access, CRM/source write, or source action
- `proposed_integration_note`: Welcome Audio lane now has a no-run Controlled
  Candidate Queue And Sandbox Send Approval Packet Design for the Controlled
  Welcome Flow Proof. It connects approved private new-follower evidence to a
  private candidate queue boundary, final already-welcomed/send-history check,
  approved audio asset boundary, sandbox send approval packet, reply/email
  handoff separation, MailerLite separation, CRM enrichment separation, storage
  policy, approval phrases, stop conditions, and closed-gate boundaries. No
  candidate queue, candidate set, approval packet, send, DM opening, source
  action, private artifact inspection, Mantis memory write, or CRM/source write
  is authorized.
- `closeout_format`: use template in
  `docs/crm-vnext/workstreams/_workstream-status-template-v0.md`.
